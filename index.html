              Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchendise flow
              across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape and
              eliminate road blocks. Where Companies import goods and
              merchendise directly into a Free Trade Zone &mdash; and then ship
              products out duty free.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia
              to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea
              transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ
              World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and
              time.
